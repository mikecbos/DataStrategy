    "The shifting market conditions, globalization, cost pressure, and volatility are leading to a change in the automobile market landscape. The emergence of data, in conjunction with machine learning in automobile companies, has paved a way that is helping bring operational and business transformations.\n",

    "The automobile market is vast and diverse, with numerous vehicle categories being manufactured and sold with varying configurations of attributes such as displacement, horsepower, and acceleration. We aim to find combinations of these features that can clearly distinguish certain groups of automobiles from others through this analysis, as this will inform other downstream processes for any organization aiming to sell each group of vehicles to a slightly different target audience.\n",

Recently, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">they have started shifting their focus to vintage cars and have been diligently collecting data about all the vintage cars they have sold over the years.
